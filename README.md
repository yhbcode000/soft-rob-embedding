# soft-rob-embedding
Unifying the representation of robot statuses and actions with natural language embeddings. This involves translating robotic states and actions into a common vector space shared with natural language, allowing AI to interpret and plan robot behaviors as if they were processing human language. This integration facilitates more intuitive and efficient robotic planning by leveraging the semantic richness of natural language embeddings.
